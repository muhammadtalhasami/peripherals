This repository contains the system verilog implementation of various peripheral modules, including SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) and I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), based on the AXI4-Lite protocol.

🚀 Features:

    AXI4-Lite interface for easy integration with SoC designs.
    Fully configurable SPI and I2C peripheral modules.
    Designed for FPGA-based systems and ASIC prototyping.
    Code is optimized for high performance and energy efficiency.

📂 Contents:

    /src - Source files for  AXi4-lite,SPI and I2C peripherals.
    /testbench - Testbench files for simulation and verification.
